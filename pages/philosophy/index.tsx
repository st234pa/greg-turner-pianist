            To me, learning to play an instrument is about expressing emotions,

            and your audience.

          <p className="pb-2">
            My lessons include frequent discussions about the character and
            emotions of pieces, and expressing these aspects is the number one
            priority. Through this process, my students learn to become not just
            better musicians but more empathetic people in general.

            Though every student progresses at their own pace, I truly believe

            never degrade, shame, or yell at my students.

            A highly supportive environment does not mean standards should drop.
            But I also understand that everyone has a different standard they
            should be held to. Expecting the impossible is a perfect way to make
            a student feel incompetent, no matter how supportive you are.
          </p>
          <p className="pb-2">
            With this in mind, I constantly adjust my standards with my students

            With this in mind, we talk a lot about practice in lessons. We talk

            We also spend time reflecting on how practice goes each week. I give
